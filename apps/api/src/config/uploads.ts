 * Single source of truth for where uploads live on disk.
 *
 * Reads `UPLOADS_DIR` and falls back to `./uploads` (workspace-local) when
 * the env var is unset. In production this MUST point at a persistent
 * volume (e.g. a Render disk mounted at /var/data/uploads) — local disk
 * on a stateless web service does not survive redeploys / instance
 * replacement, so receipts and ticket documents written there will 404
 * after the next restart.
 *
 * The names of the three sub-buckets are kept stable so persisted DB
 * URLs remain valid across env changes.
